## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### Continued development

Responsiveness - 
This webpage doesn't meet all the responsive standards. I am currently learning how to make responsive websites. When I have acquired enough knowledge, I will update this webpage. 

Hover effect - 
Hovering on the equilibrium image does not have the desired effect it should. I am hoping to learn the required methods on making the effect happen and updating this webpage.


### Useful resources
